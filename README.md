- Hint system (too high/too low)
- User-friendly interface

### Technologies Used:
- Python

### How to Run:
```bash
python guess_the_number.py

## 3. Hangman

### Description:
The classic word-guessing game, Hangman, implemented in Python. The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess it letter by letter.

### Features:
- Random word selection
- Visual hangman display
- Word completion check

### Technologies Used:
- Python

### How to Run:
```bash


python hangman.py
```
